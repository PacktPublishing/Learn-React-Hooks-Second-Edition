React Hooks allow you to easily encapsulate, reuse, and refactor logic with the same level of simplicity that components bring to user interface organization.
In this second edition, React expert and author of many popular React books, Daniel Bugl guides you through the full spectrum of React Hooks, and teaches you how to handle forms, routing, and data fetching in modern React development. This edition is fully updated to React 19, with a revamped structure, expanded real-world use cases, and coverage of all newly introduced Hooks.
Starting with the fundamentals, you'll gain a deep understanding of how Hooks work under the hood and how to apply Hooks patterns efficiently. The chapters guide you through using State, Reducer, and Effect Hooks to manage application state, side effects, and complex logic for building your first Hook-based app. You'll utilize Suspense and Context APIs for streamlined data fetching and state management, master Form Actions for handling submissions, and implement routing with Hooks. You’ll also create custom Hooks for advanced functionality and write tests for reliability. Finally, you’ll learn how to refactor an existing app with class components into modern Hooks architecture.
By the end of this React book, you'll be well-equipped to use React Hooks to modernize and optimize your React projects.</details>
